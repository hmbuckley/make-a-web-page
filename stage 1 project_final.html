  	      <p>
            The web is made up of HTML documents(Hyper text markup language).It uses hyperlinks or links to glue it all together. It was created in the early 90s.The major pieces of the web are:
          </p>
  				<p>
            <b>You</b>, your computer and your web browser, the internet, and the servers that sit in wiring closets and host all of the different types of files, such as images, videos, documents etc.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h3>HTTP(Hyper Text Transport Protocol)</h3>
        </div>

				  <p>
            <em>HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to create web pages.</em> HTML Markup uses elements that are made up of tags, content and attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many differnt types of tags such as b for bold, em for italics, br for line break and p for paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>You can insert links to other pages such as <a href="http://www.nhl.com">hockey</a> to get the latest on the nhl.
          </p>
          <p>
           Attributes have values such as nhl.com in the link above. All whitespace becomes a single line, so you can use br or p to create new lines and paragraphs.

    <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a structured document with HTML</h2>
	   <div class="subject">
       <div class="subject-title">
         <h3>Tree Structure</h3>
       </div>
  			<div class="subject-description">               
		      <p>
            When coding, it is good practice to use a tree structure to identify the diffeerent elements. Also when writing code it is good to use indents to keep your code easy to read.
          </p>

        <div class="subject-title">       
		      <h3>All elements are boxes</h3>
        </div>
 			  <div class="subject-description">
		      <p>
            When designing a web page start by identifying the big boxes and then working down to the smaller boxes.Sketch it out with a pencil.The div tag is used to create boxes. Use classes to label the boxes. For web pages <b>HTML</b> are the structure and Css is the style(colors, fonts, sizes).</p>

    <h2>Lesson 3 Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
    <div class="subject">
     <div class="subject-title">
      <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
      </div>
        <div class="subject-description">                        
          <p>
            CSS is used to add style to your web page. When adding style to a document there are three differnet ways to include CSS code. You can put the code in the head section ( this works ok for small projects); write the style inline with your HTML (this is not recommended as it causes a lot of repeat coding); create a seperate css file that you link to(this is the best way to use CSS).
          </p>  
        </div>
      </div>  
    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title">
        <h3>Re-using Code</h3>
      </div>
        <div class="subject-description">                        
          <p>
            When writing code you want to try to re-use as much as you can so that you are not continually re-writing the same code. The use of the div class name allows us to apply the same style to similar elements without having to re-write the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I must admit while creating this webpage I became the victim of cutting and pasting bad code as I was creating the different class names. The simple error of leaving out a leading " caused the same problem for each of my divs. This was a great lesson to learn.</p>
